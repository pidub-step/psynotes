## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Transcription Service Dependencies**
   - ffmpeg is required for audio processing
   - Need to ensure availability in deployment environment
   - Status: Verified working in development, needs verification in production

2. **Large File Processing**
   - Long recordings create large WAV files
   - Splitting and processing takes time
   - Status: Implemented but needs performance testing

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Audio recording has different behaviors across browsers
   - Safari on iOS requires specific handling
   - Status: Basic implementation complete, needs thorough testing

4. **Processing Time Expectations**
   - Transcription of long recordings takes significant time
   - Users need clear feedback during processing
   - Status: Status indicators implemented, could be enhanced with time estimates
