   - ✅ Structured Note Modal component implemented for viewing and editing structured notes

2. **Backend Implementation**
   - ✅ Supabase storage bucket and database table created
   - ✅ Transcription service designed with FastAPI
   - ✅ OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe/gpt-4o-mini-transcribe models integration
   - ✅ Audio file processing with ffmpeg for high-quality transcription
   - ✅ Structured Notes service implemented with FastAPI and OpenAI GPT-4

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - ✅ End-to-end testing of recording, uploading, and transcription
   - ✅ Performance optimization for large audio files
   - ✅ Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - ✅ Fixed npm run dev execution path issue
   - ✅ Tested structured notes generation and display

4. **Code Quality and Maintenance**
   - ✅ Fixed syntax errors in record page (missing commas, proper function parameters)
   - ✅ Fixed syntax errors in transcriptions page (duplicate components, import paths)
   - ✅ Synchronized GitHub repository with local code
   - ✅ Ensured consistent code style across the application
   - ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in structured notes service files
   - ✅ Implemented proper environment variable handling with .env.example files

## Recent Decisions

1. **Transcription Service Architecture**
   - Implemented a standalone FastAPI service for transcription processing
   - Used ffmpeg for audio file splitting to handle large recordings
   - Maintained high audio quality with WAV format (44.1kHz stereo)
   - Integrated with OpenAI's gpt-4o-transcribe models for accurate transcription

2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - Implemented API routes in Next.js for communication with the transcription service
   - Created a webhook-style update mechanism for transcription status updates
   - Used Supabase signed URLs for secure file access
   - Added new API endpoint for updating transcription text

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling in the transcription service
   - Added status updates to track transcription progress
   - Created fallback mechanisms for transcription failures

4. **UI Performance Optimization**
   - Removed polling mechanism that was causing UI flashing
   - Optimized Supabase Realtime subscription to handle events individually
   - Implemented optimistic UI updates for better user experience
   - Disabled React Strict Mode to prevent double-rendering in development

5. **Repository Structure Improvement**
   - Converted medical-note-transcriber from a git submodule to a regular directory
   - Simplified the repository structure for easier management
   - Improved developer experience by making all files directly trackable
   - Force pushed local code to GitHub to ensure synchronization

6. **Bug Fixing and Code Quality**
   - Fixed syntax errors in record page (missing commas, proper function parameters)
   - Fixed syntax errors in transcriptions page (duplicate components, import paths)
   - Ensured proper execution of npm commands from the correct directory
   - Verified all pages are working correctly (home, record, transcriptions)

7. **Structured Notes Feature Implementation**
   - Created a separate FastAPI service for structured notes generation
   - Implemented CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests
   - Used OpenAI GPT-4 to transform raw transcriptions into structured medical notes
   - Added a modal component for viewing and editing structured notes
   - Created proper environment configuration with .env.example files
   - Implemented secure handling of API keys

## Active Considerations

1. **Transcription Quality vs. Processing Time**
   - We're using high-quality audio (44.1kHz stereo WAV) for better transcription results
   - This increases processing time but improves accuracy for medical terminology
   - Monitoring needed to ensure this doesn't create performance issues

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - The frontend can be deployed to Vercel
   - The transcription service requires a platform that supports Python and ffmpeg
   - The structured notes service requires a platform that supports Python
   - Need to ensure proper environment variable configuration

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - The current implementation works well for individual users
   - For multiple concurrent users, may need to implement a queue system
   - Consider serverless vs. dedicated hosting for the transcription and structured notes services

4. **User Experience During Processing**
   - Current implementation shows clear status indicators during transcription
   - Realtime subscription updates the status in the UI
   - Consider adding estimated time remaining for longer recordings
   - Structured notes generation provides immediate feedback with modal display

5. **Code Maintenance and Quality**
   - Importance of proper syntax and code formatting
   - Need for consistent error handling across the application
   - Regular testing to ensure all components work together correctly
   - Keeping GitHub repository in sync with local development
   - Proper handling of environment variables and sensitive information

6. **Security Considerations**
   - Implemented proper .gitignore files to prevent committing sensitive information
   - Created .env.example files with placeholders instead of actual keys
   - Removed API keys from git history when accidentally committed
   - Used environment variables for all sensitive information

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test with various recording lengths and qualities
   - Optimize the transcription process for faster results
   - Test on different browsers and devices, especially Safari on iOS
   - Test structured notes generation with various medical note formats

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Prepare deployment configurations for Vercel (frontend)
   - Set up deployment for the transcription service
   - Set up deployment for the structured notes service
   - Establish environment variables for production

3. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation with setup and usage instructions
   - Document the API endpoints and service architecture
   - Create deployment guides for both frontend and backend
   - Document the structured notes feature and its usage

4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Consider adding authentication for multi-user support
   - Explore integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems
   - Investigate specialized medical vocabulary training for the transcription model
   - Enhance structured notes with additional formatting options
