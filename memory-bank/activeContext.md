# Active Context: Medical Note Transcription App

## Current Development Focus

We are now in the **implementation phase** of the Medical Note Transcription App. We have moved beyond initial planning and have made significant progress in implementing the core functionality of the application.

### Current Priorities

1. **Frontend Implementation**
   - âœ… Next.js project setup completed
   - âœ… Recording component implemented with Recorder.js
   - âœ… Upload component implemented for Supabase Storage
   - âœ… Transcriptions display page implemented
   - âœ… API routes for transcription service communication

2. **Backend Implementation**
   - âœ… Supabase storage bucket and database table created
   - âœ… Transcription service designed with FastAPI
   - âœ… OpenAI GPT-4o Transcribe API integration
   - âœ… Audio file processing with ffmpeg for high-quality transcription

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - ðŸ”„ End-to-end testing of recording, uploading, and transcription
   - ðŸ”„ Performance optimization for large audio files
   - ðŸ”„ Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Recent Decisions

1. **Transcription Service Architecture**
   - Implemented a standalone FastAPI service for transcription processing
   - Used ffmpeg for audio file splitting to handle large recordings
   - Maintained high audio quality with WAV format (44.1kHz, stereo)
   - Integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4o Transcribe API for improved accuracy

2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - Implemented API routes in Next.js for communication with the transcription service
   - Created a webhook-style update mechanism for transcription status updates
   - Used Supabase signed URLs for secure file access

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling in the transcription service
   - Added status updates to track transcription progress
   - Created fallback mechanisms for transcription failures

## Active Considerations

1. **Transcription Quality vs. Processing Time**
   - We're using high-quality audio (44.1kHz, stereo WAV) for better transcription results
   - This increases processing time but improves accuracy for medical terminology
   - Monitoring needed to ensure this doesn't create performance issues

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - The frontend can be deployed to Vercel
   - The transcription service requires a platform that supports Python and ffmpeg
   - Need to ensure proper environment variable configuration

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - The current implementation works well for individual users
   - For multiple concurrent users, may need to implement a queue system
   - Consider serverless vs. dedicated hosting for the transcription service

4. **User Experience During Processing**
   - Current implementation shows clear status indicators during transcription
   - Polling mechanism updates the status in the UI
   - Consider adding estimated time remaining for longer recordings

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test with various recording lengths and qualities
   - Optimize the transcription process for faster results
   - Test on different browsers and devices, especially Safari on iOS

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Prepare deployment configurations for Vercel (frontend)
   - Set up deployment for the transcription service
   - Establish environment variables for production

3. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation with setup and usage instructions
   - Document the API endpoints and service architecture
   - Create deployment guides for both frontend and backend

4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Consider adding authentication for multi-user support
   - Explore integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems
   - Investigate specialized medical vocabulary training for the transcription model

## Open Questions

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - How can we further optimize the transcription process for faster results?
   - Are there ways to reduce the file size while maintaining transcription quality?

2. **Deployment Options**
   - What is the most cost-effective hosting solution for the transcription service?
   - How can we ensure reliable operation in production?

3. **User Feedback**
   - How can we gather feedback on transcription quality and accuracy?
   - What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the solution?

## Current Blockers

1. **ffmpeg Dependency**
   - The transcription service requires ffmpeg for audio processing
   - Need to ensure this is available in the deployment environment
   - Status: Documented in README, needs verification in production

2. **Long-Running Processes**
   - Transcription of long recordings can take significant time
   - Need to ensure the service can handle timeouts and interruptions
   - Status: Basic implementation complete, needs stress testing
